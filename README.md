# tasky
Lua scripting API for Minecraft bots with A* pathfinding

# When will this be done?

Tasky is actually fully functional except for the text editor. I sort of got bored and stopped working on it in August of 2019.

# Features

- 35 functional hooks (and more coming as Tasky grows)
- A* pathfinding with `moveTo`
- In-game text editor for scripts (wip)
